This website is my first commercial project for insurance agent on a low budget.

I learned a lot from this project because I worked directly with client and I had to do everything alone from the beginning such as:<br>
1.  Research for trending designs in the insurance industry<br>
2.  Get to know client needs, even helped with the content for him<br>
3.  Drawing a project of website layout and discuss all the functionalities<br>
4.  Make a design in Figma for a client to accept<br>
5.  Coding<br>
6.  Prepare domain and hosting.<br>

I have done it in html/css/js from scratch, although I used swiperJs component. I got inspired by few different tutorials of Web Developers that I admire. 
The code which I dropped on github is a bit different than the live server. I started writing script using JavaScript Intersection Observer to fade and slide some elements to make page a bit more alive but dropped it due to lack of time - unfortunatelly my client refused to pay for future updates due to unsuccessful campaign.


The website is now live on https://pelszyk-ubezpieczenia.pl/
